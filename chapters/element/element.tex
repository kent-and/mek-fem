\chapter{Some common finite elements}
\label{element}

\section{Introduction}

There is a jungle of finite elements that have been invented since the early 1940s. We
will not here give a comprehensive description of all of these elements, but 
rather try to illustrate the concept and show some simple examples before we discuss some of the general features. 
The formal definition of a finite element, according to Ciarlet~\cite{ciarlet2002finite} is: 

\begin{defin}
A finite element is defined by a triplet $(T, V, D)$, where 
\begin{itemize}
\item $T$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$, most typically a polyhedron; 
\item $V = \{\psi_i\}_{i=1}^n$ is a set of linearly independent basis functions on $T$; 
\item $D = \{d_i\}^n_{i=1}$ is a set of (linearly independent) 
	degrees of freedom defined in terms of linear functionals on $V$. (We remark for $v\in V$ we may evaluate $d_i(v)$ 
		since $d_i$ is a linear functional on $V$.) 
\end{itemize}
\end{defin}
As we see, the term "finite element" refers not only to the cells of the mesh, but also an associated function space and its degrees of freedom. 
The function space is defined locally, with respect to each cell of the mesh, but will as we will see later be tied together through 
the degrees of freedom. 
The definition is quite abstract, but as we will see, the definition encapsulates precisely what is needed in order to define a numerical method on a mesh. 

Further, most finite elements are implemented in terms of its \emph{nodal basis}. The nodal basis is defined as follows: 
\begin{defin}
\label{nodal:basis}
The nodal basis for the triplet  $(T, V, D)$ is defined as the set of basis functions
$\{\phi_i\}^n_{i=1}$ that satisfies  
\[
	d_j(\phi_i) = \delta_{ij}, \quad \mbox{ for } 1 \le i,j \le n. 
\]
The $\{d_j\}^n_{i=1}$ is often called the dual basis of the finite element.  
\end{defin}

\section{Some example finite elements: Lagrange and Hermite on the unit interval. }
Let us now try to make this concrete in a couple of simple examples. First we notice that  
in the above, we have two function spaces $\{\psi_i\}$ and $\{\phi_i\}$. Clearly, 
\begin{equation}
\label{fem:abstract:nodal}
\phi_i = \sum \alpha_{ij}\psi_j,  
\end{equation}
where the matrix $\alpha_{ij}$ is determined such that 
\[
d_i(\phi_j) = d_i(\sum \alpha_{ij} \psi_j) = \delta_{ij}. 
\]
Hence, let then $V=\mathbb{P}_k$, the space of polynomials of order up to $k$,  and lets consider the Lagrange and Hermite elements, defined in terms
of Lagrange and Hermite interpolation, respectively.  
In 1D, 
\[
\mathbb{P}_k = \{1, x, \ldots, x^k\}. 
\]
Clearly, $\mathbb{P}_k$ has $k+1$ basis functions  and they are all linearly independent. 
Below we calculate the $\alpha_{ij}$ in terms of Lagrange and Hermite interpolation in 
order to definite the Lagrange and Hermite elements, respectively. 

\begin{exmp}[\textbf{The Lagrange element in 1D.}]
\label{lagrange:element}
Lagrange interpolation is defined simply by nodal values in a set of points. Hence, 
let 
\[
x_j = j \Delta x, \quad \Delta x = \frac{1}{k}, \quad  j= 0, \dots, k 
\]
The Lagrange element of order $k$ should span $\mathbb{P}_k$, but its degrees of freedom should the nodal values of the above mentioned points. Hence,   
the j'th Lagrange function $L_j(x)$ can according to \eqref{fem:abstract:nodal} be written as a linear combination of the basis of $\mathbb{P}_k$ as 
\[ 
L_j(x) = \sum_{i=0}^k \alpha_{ij} x^i 
\]
where $\alpha_{ij}$ are determined by 
\[ 
d_i(L_j) = L_j(x_i) = \sum_{i=0}^k \alpha_{ij} x^i_i = \delta_{ij} . 
\]
From this linear system we may calculate the $\alpha_{ij}$ for each specific basis function. 
In 1D, an explicit formulation can be derived for $L_j$, namely 
\[
L_j(x) = \frac{x-x_0}{x_j-x_0} \ldots \frac{x-x_{j-1}}{x_j-x_{j-1}} \ldots \frac{x-x_{j+1}}{x_j-x_{j+1}} \ldots \frac{x-x_k}{x_j-x_k}  
\]
By inspecting the above formula, it is clear that for instance $L_j(x_0) = 0, j\not= 0$ whereas  $L_j(x_j) = 1$.  
\end{exmp}
The Lagrange element  can be written up in terms of an explicit formula in 1D, but is harder in higher dimensions.
Therefore, we provide a simple code here that illustrates how such elements may be implemented. 
The below code is conceptually similar to the finite element tabulators used in FEniCS~\cite{kirby2012constructing,kirby2012fiat,alnaes2012syfi}.   
The following code computes the basis directly from the abstract definition without references to the above formula, using SymPy.  
\begin{python}
from sympy import * 

def dirac(i,j): 
  if i == j: return 1 
  else: return 0 

k = 5  
x = Symbol("x") 
dx = 1/k 

basis = [x**j for j in range(0, k+1)] 
points = [j*dx for j in range(0, k+1)] 
dofs = symbols("a:%d"%(k+1))

print ("A polynomial space         ", basis) 
print ("Points for the nodal basis ", points) 
print ("The degrees of freedom (symbols) ", dofs) 

pol = sum([dofs[i]*basis[i] for i in range(0, (k+1))])   
print ("A generic polynomial       ", pol)

Lagrange_basis = []
for i in range(0, (k+1)): 
  equations = []
  for j in range(len(points)):  
    p = points[j]
    eq = pol.subs(x,p) - dirac(i,j) 
    equations.append(eq)
  coeff = solve(equations, dofs) 
  Nj = pol.subs(coeff)
  Lagrange_basis.append(Nj) 

for i, basis in enumerate(Lagrange_basis): 
    print ("basis ", i, " ", Lagrange_basis[i]) 

# check that the Lagrange basis is what it is supposed to be 
for i, basis in enumerate(Lagrange_basis): 
    for j, point in enumerate(points): 
        print ("i,j ", i,j, " basis evaluation ",  "%0.3f" % basis.subs({ x: point})) 


\end{python}
The output is as follows: 
\begin{python}
A polynomial space          [1, x, x**2, x**3, x**4, x**5]
Points for the nodal basis  [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6000000000000001, 0.8, 1.0]

\end{python}
The 6 basis functions of the Largrange element of order 5 is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Lagrange5}. 
Exercise \ref{lagrange:triangle} will consider a code for defining a Lagrange element of arbitrary order on a reference triangle.

The Hermite interpolation generalize the Lagrange interpolation by including also the first order derivative. 
The Hermite element is defined in terms of the Hermite interpolation. This is detailed in the following example. 

\begin{exmp}{\textbf{The Hermite element in 1D}.} 
\label{hermite:element}
Let us consider the Hermite interpolation onto $k+1$ points.  
Each point is associated with two degrees of freedom, the function evaluation and the evaluation of the first 
derivative of the function.  
using $m$ derivatives in each point. Hence,  
the number of degrees of freedom, or the number of equations defined by the specification of the nodal 
basis in Definition \ref{nodal:basis} are then $2(k+1)$. As such our polynomial space would be $\mathbb{P}_{2(k+1)}$.    
We may compute the nodal basis of the Hermite element: 
Let $H_j$ be the j'th nodal basis, expressed as  
\[ 
H_j = \sum_i \alpha_{ij} x^i 
\]
Then 
where $\alpha_{ij}$ are determined by 
\[ 
d_i(L_j) = L_j(x_i) = \delta_{ij} . 
\]
Here, lets split the degrees of freedom into even and odd numbers, where the even numbering refers to 
point evaluations whereas the odd numbers are the evaluation of the derivatives. 
That is 
\begin{align*} 
d_i(H_j) &= H_j(x_i)  &=  \delta_{ij}, \quad \mbox{ even } i,j   \\
d_i(H_j) &= H'_j(x) |_{x=x_i} &= \delta_{ij}, \quad \mbox{ odd } i,j  
\end{align*}

\end{exmp}


\section{Mapping a reference element onto a physical element. }

There are a two concepts that needs to be introduced before the above definition of the finite element is really useful.
The first concept is the mapping from a \emph{reference element} to a \emph{physical element}. 
A crucial observation is the fact that the mapping between an arbitrary cell of a general mesh and the reference cell can be generalized to 
a mapping between an arbitrary finite element on the mesh and a corresponding reference element.  
This observation is detailed below. 

Let $x$ and $\hat{x}$ be coordiates in the domains $T$ and $\hat{T}$, respectively. 
The domains $T$ and $\hat{T}$ are assumed of similar shape (isomorphic) 
and here we  
for simplicity assume an affine mapping between the coordinates:  
\[
x = F_T(\hat{x}) = A_T \hat{x} + x_0   
\]
The Jacobian of the mapping is 
\[
\frac{\partial x}{\partial \hat{x}} = J(\hat{x}) = A_T      
\]
For isoparametric elements, a basis function $\phi$
is the simply defined in terms of its associated function $\hat{\phi}$
on the reference
element, ie. 
\[
\phi(x) = \hat{\phi}(\hat{x}) .  
\]
With this definition we may easily evaluate integrals involving the basis functions: 
\[
\int_T \phi(x) \, dx = \int_{\hat{T}} \hat{\phi}(\hat{x}) \, det J \, d\hat{x},  
\]
where $det J$ is the determinant of $J$.  Furthermore, derivatives of the basis functions are readily available by using the chain-rule:  
\[
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_i } = \sum_j  \frac{\partial \hat{\phi}}{\partial \hat{x}_j } \frac{\partial \hat{x}_j}{\partial \hat{x}_i } 
\]
As such the finite element engines may perform all the computations on the reference cells, which makes the implementation easy and efficient. 

\section{The connectivity of the mesh and its finite element space}

The second concept that needs to be dealt with is how to tie the finite elements together. 
Consider for example the Lagrange element of order 5 in 1D that was illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:Lagrange5}. We observe here that the basis function $0$ and $5$ are associated
with the edges $x=0$ and $x=1$, respectively. The other functions are all zero at the edges. Hence, the basis function $1, \ldots, 4$ do not connect 
to any other element, whereas the basis $0$ would directly connect to the a corresponding element on the left whereas basis $5$ connects to the 
an element on the right, if present. Hence the edge nodes defines the connectivity and hereby the continuity towards the neighbouring elements. 

The situation is more complicated in 2D and 3D. Consider the Lagrange element of order 1, 2, and 3 in Fig.~\ref{fig:lagrangeelement13}. Black, blue and red circles mark
the vertex, edge and interal nodes, which through the connectivity of the mesh defines the connectivity of the finite element filed. 
Consider the mesh in Fig.~\ref{fig:Lagrange8elements}. Clearly, the vertex node in the center, marked by a black circle is connected to all the 8 neighbouring elements. 
Hence, the corresponding basis function ties these eight elements together. On the other hand the edge degrees of freedom marked in 
blue only connect the two elements with common face. Finally, the internal degree of freedom does connect to any other elements and is often refered to as a bubble
function.

\section{Approximation in  $L^2$, $H^1$, $H^2$, $H(\mbox{div})$, and $H(\mbox{curl})$ }

The function spaces 
$L^2$, $H^1$, $H^2$, $H(\mbox{div})$, and $H(\mbox{curl})$ 
have different requirement with respect to continuity across cell boundaries (within a cell, all common finite elements are 
polynomials and hence $C^\infty$). In $L^2$ no continuity is required and as such there is no need to tie vertex or face
degrees of freedom together. Hence, for example, in Fig. \ref{fig:dgcg} we have a mesh in 1D consisting of two cells $(0, 0.5)$ and
$(0.5, 1.0)$. Locally, the first order Lagrange element is defined in terms of the vertices, ie. for the first element the points
$x=0.0$ and $x=0.5$ whereas for the second element the points are $x=0.5$ and $x=1.0$. Both a discontinuous and a continuous
function is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:dgcg}, corresponding to discontinuous and continuous Lagrange elements on this simple mesh. 
A crucial difference between fields is whether the function is continuous at $x=0.5$ or not. 
We notice further that the discontinuous field has four degrees of freedom $x=0.0$, $x=0.5-$, $x=0.5+$, and $x=1.0$, whereas
the continuous field only has three degrees of freedom $x=0.0$, $x=0.5$, and $x=1.0$. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{chapters/element/dg.pdf}

\caption{Piecewise discontinuous and continuous first order polynomials defined in terms of two cells in 1D. }  
\label{fig:dgcg}
\end{center}
\end{figure}



It is clear that the piecewise discontinuous and continuous field shown  in Fig. \ref{fig:dgcg} are contained in $L^2(0,1)$. 
However, computing the derivative of the leftmost field would yield a postive number in the interval $x=(0,0.5)$ and a negative number
in the interval $x=(0.5,1)$. However, for $x=0.5$ the derivative is minus infinity. Hence, the $H^1$ norm of the function would be
infinity and the function is not contained in $H^1(0,1)$. 
In general piecewise discontinuous polynomials are contained in $L^2$ on bounded domains, whereas 
piecewise continuous polynomials are contained in $H^1$. Further, piecewise polynomials with continuous derivatives are contained in $H^2$.   
Hence, Hermite elements can be used to make approximations in $H^2$ if tied together such that the derivatives are continuous. However, even
though the nodal derivatives are degrees of freedom it is still challenging to tie many elements together and maintain continuous derivatives. 
The Hermite element is therefore typically on used for tensor product meshes. 

Elements that are contained in a Soblev space are call \emph{conforming}. For instance, the continuous Lagrange elements  described above are $H^1$-conforming (and $L^2$-conforming). 

Up until now, our Sobolev space and approximations have been scalar valued. However, it is straightforward to generalized the concepts from scalar fields to vector field. 
For instance, if our finite element approximation of a scalar field is 
\[
u_h = \sum_{i=1}^N u_i N_i,  
\]
then a corresponding approximation of a vector field could be 
\[
u_h = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{d=1}^D  u^d_i N_i e^d,  
\]
where $e^d$ is the unit vector in $\mathbb{R}^D$. We notice that the vector field has $D N$ degrees of freedom while the scalar field has $N$.  
However, vector field may also be defined in terms of finite elements that are defined in terms of degrees of freedom that
correspond to vectors.  The spaces $H(\mbox{div})$ and $H(\mbox{curl})$ are important in this setting.  

To motivate the spaces $H(\mbox{div})$ and $H(\mbox{curl})$ let us first notice that we have the
following identity  in 3D (which may be verified by direct compuation)
\[
\Delta = \nabla \nabla \cdot - \nabla\times \nabla \times.   
\]
Here, we note that $\nabla$ is the gradient, $\nabla\cdot$ the divergence, and $\nabla\times$ the curl.  
Furthermore $\Delta = \nabla^2 = \nabla\cdot\nabla$. Assuming homogenuous Dirichlet conditions
it directly follows that 
\begin{align}
(\nabla u, \nabla v) = (\nabla \cdot u, \nabla \cdot v)  + (\nabla\times u,  \nabla \times v), \quad u\in H^1(\Omega), v\in H_0^1(\Omega)     
\label{graddivcurl}
\end{align}
It follows that
\begin{align*}
H^1 \subset H(\mbox{div}) \subset L^2, \\   
H^1 \subset H(\mbox{curl}) \subset L^2 .    
\end{align*}
In fact, on simple domains, 
\[
H_0^1 = H_0(\mbox{div}) \cap H_0(\mbox{curl}) .  
\]
as indicated by the identity \eqref{graddivcurl}. 
Integration by parts of the operators $\nabla$, $\nabla\cdot$ and 
$\nabla \times$ are governed by the Green's lemma, divergence theorem
and Stokes' theorem respectively. The divergence theorem states 
that for a vector field $f$ we have 
\[
	\int_\Omega \nabla \cdot f\, dx = \int_{\partial \Omega} f \cdot n \, ds  .  
\]
In other words, the divergence of a function within a domain, or in our case a mesh cell, is
related to the normal component of the edges of the mesh cell. As such a discretization
in $H(\mbox{div})$ is usually based on the normal components on the element faces that ensures continuity in the normal direction, while jumps
in the tangents are permitted. 
In Fig. ~\ref{fig:rtetc} (upper left), we see the lowest order Raviart-Thomas element, one of the most common finite elements used to approximate $H(\mbox{div})$. 

Similarly, as the divergence theorem relates divergence to normal vectors, the Stokes' theorem relates the curl operator to edge tangent vectors. The lowest order Nedelec element, one of the most common finite elements in  $H(\mbox{curl})$  is shown Fig. ~\ref{fig:rtetc} (upper right). The Nedelec element uses the tangent degrees of freedom to ensure continuity in the tangent direction across element boundaries. 

The Raviart-Thomas element are conforming in $H(\mbox{div})$ while 
the Nedelec element is conforming in $H(\mbox{curl})$. Just as for the Lagrange element, these elements may be defined of arbitrary order, and they are all available in FEniCS. The theory of    $H(\mbox{div})$ and $H(\mbox{curl})$ is somewhat more complicated that $H^1$ but there are excellent books~\cite{arnold2018finite, boffi2013mixed}. 

Finally, motivated by the identity \ref{graddivcurl} one may be motivated to define an $H^1$ element in terms of edge normals and tangent vectors. The Crouizeix-Raviart and the Mardal-Tai-Winther elements are both efforts in this direction. We remark, that although not obvious from the above reasoning, both elements are non-conforming, but both elements still constitute approximations of $H^1$ of the expected order.  
A detailed description of the implementation  of these and other elements 
in FEniCS and Firedrake can be found in \cite{aznaran2022transformations, scroggs2022basix}

\section{Exercises}


\begin{exercise}
Consider two triangles $T_0$ and $T_1$ defined by the vertices $(0,0), (1,0), (1,0)$ and
$(3,4), (4,2), (4,4)$. Computing the mapping between them.  
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
\label{hermite:interval}
Make a Python code that defines a Hermite on the unit interval.       
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}
\label{lagrange:triangle}
Make a Python code that defines a Lagrange element of arbitrary order on the reference triangle 
consisting of the vertices $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$. Let $\mathbb{P}_k = \{ x^i y^j \} \mbox{ for } i,j \mbox{ such that } i+j \le k\} $     
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Check that the interpolation result
of the Bramble-Hilbert lemma \ref{bramblehilbert} applies to the Lagrange interpolation on the unit line. Consider 
for example a function $f = sin(x)$ on the unit interval. The function $f$ is a good example as it cannot be expressed 
as a polynomial of finite order, but can be approximated arbitrary well. 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Compute the condition number of the mass matrix when using the Lagrange and the Hermite basis. Compare it with the condition
number when using the basis consisting of monomials, ie. $(1, x, x^2, \ldots)$.   
	The mass matrix on the unit interval  is the matrix $M_{ij} = \int_0^1 \phi_i \phi_j \, dx $ where $\{\phi_i\}$ is 
	the set of basis functions in use.
