\chapter{Some common finite elements}
\label{element}

\section{Introduction}

There is a jungle of finite elements that have been invented since the early 1940s, and we
will not here give a comprehensive description of the topic. Instead, we will try to motivate
the method by rather simple examples before we discuss some of the general features. 
The formal definition of a finite element, according to Ciarlet~\cite{ciarlet2002finite} is: 

\begin{defin}
A finite element is defined by a triplet $(T, V, D)$, where 
\begin{itemize}
\item $T$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$, most typically a polyhedron; 
\item $V = \{\psi_i\}_{i=1}^n$ is a set of linearly independent basis functions on $T$; 
\item $D = \{d_i\}^n_{i=1}$ is a set of (linearly independent) 
	degrees of freedom defined in terms of linear functionals on $V$. (We remark for $v\in V$ we may evaluate $d_i(v)$ 
		since $d_i$ is a linear functional on $V$.) 
\end{itemize}
\end{defin}
As we see, the term "finite element" refers not only to the cells of the mesh, but also the function space and associated degrees of freedom. The definition is quite abstract, but as we will see, the definition encapsulates precisely what is needed in order to define a numerical method on a mesh. 

Further, most finite elements are implemented in terms of its \emph{nodal basis}. The nodal basis is defined as follows: 
\begin{defin}
\label{nodal:basis}
The nodal basis for the triplet  $(T, V, D)$ is defined as the set of basis functions
$\{\phi_i\}^n_{i=1}$ that satisfies  
\[
	d_j(\phi_i) = \delta_{ij}, \quad \mbox{ for } 1 \le i,j \le n. 
\]
The $\{d_j\}^n_{i=1}$ is often called the dual basis of the finite element.  
\end{defin}

\section{Some example finite elements: Lagrange and Hermite on the unit interval. }
Let us now try to make this concrete in a couple of simple examples. First we notice that  
in the above, we have two function spaces $\{\psi_i\}$ and $\{\phi_i\}$. Clearly, 
\[
\phi_i = \sum \alpha_{ij}\psi_j,  
\]
where the matrix $\alpha_{ij}$ is determined such that 
\[
d_i(\phi_j) = d_i(\sum \alpha_{ij} \psi_j) = \delta_{ij}. 
\]
Hence, let then $V=\mathbb{P}_k$, the space of polynomials of order up to $k$,  and lets consider the Lagrange and Hermite elements, defined in terms
of Lagrange and Hermite interpolation, respectively.  
On the unit interval
\[
\mathbb{P}_k = \{1, x, \ldots, x^k\}. 
\]
Clearly, $\mathbb{P}_k$ has $k+1$ basis functions  and they are all linearly independent. 
The Lagrange and Hermite elements are then defined in the examples below. 
\begin{exmp}[\textbf{The Lagrange element in 1D.}]
\label{lagrange:element}
Lagrange interpolation is defined simply by nodal values in a set of points. Hence, 
let 
\[
x_j = j \Delta x, \quad \Delta x = \frac{1}{k}, \quad  j= 0, \dots, k 
\]
	Then the j'th Lagrange function $L_j(x)$ can be written as a linear combination of the basis of $\mathbb{P}_k$ as 
\[ 
L_j(x) = \sum_{i=0}^k \alpha_{ij} x^i 
\]
where $\alpha_{ij}$ are determined by 
\[ 
d_i(L_j) = L_j(x_i) = \sum_{i=0}^k \alpha_{ij} x^i_i = \delta_{ij} . 
\]
From this linear system we may calculate the $\alpha_{ij}$ for each specific basis function. 

In 1D, an explicit formulation can be derived for $L_j$, namely 
\[
L_j(x) = \frac{x-x_0}{x_j-x_0} \ldots \frac{x-x_{j-1}}{x_j-x_{j-1}} \ldots \frac{x-x_{j+1}}{x_j-x_{j+1}} \ldots \frac{x-x_k}{x_j-x_k}  
\]
Clearly, for instance $L_j(x_0) = 0$ whereas  $L_j(x_j) = 1$.  
\end{exmp}
The Lagrange element  can be written up in terms of an explicit formula in 1D, but is harder in higher dimensions.
Therefore, we provide a simple code here that illustrates how such elements may be implemented. 
The below code is conceptually similar to the finite element tabulators used in FEniCS~\cite{kirby2012constructing,kirby2012fiat,alnaes2012syfi}.   
The following code computes the basis directly from the abstract definition without references to the above formula, using SymPy.  
\begin{python}
from sympy import * 

def dirac(i,j): 
  if i == j: return 1 
  else: return 0 

k = 5  
x = Symbol("x") 
dx = 1/k 

basis = [x**j for j in range(0, k+1)] 
points = [j*dx for j in range(0, k+1)] 
dofs = symbols("a:%d"%(k+1))

print ("A polynomial space         ", basis) 
print ("Points for the nodal basis ", points) 
print ("The degrees of freedom (symbols) ", dofs) 

pol = sum([dofs[i]*basis[i] for i in range(0, (k+1))])   
print ("A generic polynomial       ", pol)

Lagrange_basis = []
for i in range(0, (k+1)): 
  equations = []
  for j in range(len(points)):  
    p = points[j]
    eq = pol.subs(x,p) - dirac(i,j) 
    equations.append(eq)
  coeff = solve(equations, dofs) 
  Nj = pol.subs(coeff)
  Lagrange_basis.append(Nj) 

for i, basis in enumerate(Lagrange_basis): 
    print ("basis ", i, " ", Lagrange_basis[i]) 

# check that the Lagrange basis is what it is supposed to be 
for i, basis in enumerate(Lagrange_basis): 
    for j, point in enumerate(points): 
        print ("i,j ", i,j, " basis evaluation ",  "%0.3f" % basis.subs({ x: point})) 


\end{python}
The output is as follows: 
\begin{python}
A polynomial space          [1, x, x**2, x**3, x**4, x**5]
Points for the nodal basis  [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6000000000000001, 0.8, 1.0]
The degrees of freedom (symbols)  (a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5)
A generic polynomial        a0 + a1*x + a2*x**2 + a3*x**3 + a4*x**4 + a5*x**5
basis  0   -26.0416666666667*x**5 + 78.125*x**4 .... 
basis  1   130.208333333333*x**5 - 364.583333333333*x**4 .... 
...
i,j  0 0  basis evaluation  1.000
i,j  0 1  basis evaluation  0.000
...
\end{python}
The 6 basis functions of the Largrange element of order 5 is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Lagrange5}. 
Exercise \ref{lagrange:triangle} will consider a code for defining a Lagrange element of arbitrary order on a reference triangle.

\end{figure}


The Hermite interpolation generalize the Lagrange interpolation by including also the first order derivative. As such 
the Hermite element is defined in terms of the Hermite interpolation. This is detailed in the following example: 
\begin{exmp}{\textbf{The Hermite element in 1D}.} 
\label{hermite:element}
Let us consider the Hermite interpolation onto $k+1$ points.  
Each point is associated with two degrees of freedom, the function evaluation and the evaluation of the first 
derivative of the function.  
using $m$ derivatives in each point. Hence,  
the number of degrees of freedom, or the number of equations defined by the specification of the nodal 
basis in Definition \ref{nodal:basis} are then $2(k+1)$. As such our polynomial space would be $\mathbb{P}_{2(k+1)}$.    
We may compute the nodal basis of the Hermite element: 
Let $H_j$ be the j'th nodal basis, expressed as  
\[ 
H_j = \sum_i \alpha_{ij} x^i 
\]
Then 
where $\alpha_{ij}$ are determined by 
\[ 
d_i(L_j) = L_j(x_i) = \delta_{ij} . 
\]
Here, lets split the degrees of freedom into even and odd numbers, where the even numbering refers to 
point evaluations whereas the odd numbers are the evaluation of the derivatives. 
That is 
\begin{align*} 
d_i(H_j) &= H_j(x_i)  &=  \delta_{ij}, \quad \mbox{ even } i,j   \\
d_i(H_j) &= H'_j(x) |_{x=x_i} &= \delta_{ij}, \quad \mbox{ odd } i,j  
\end{align*}

\end{exmp}


\section{Mapping a reference element onto a physical element. }

There are a couple of observations that makes the above definition of the finite element really useful.
First, lets consider the mappings from a reference element to a physical element. A crucial observation
is the fact that 
the mapping between an arbitrary cell of a general mesh and the reference cell can be generalized to 
a mapping between an arbitrary finite element on the mesh and a corresponding reference element.  
This observation is detailed below. 

Let $x$ and $\hat{x}$ be coordiates in the domains $T$ and $\hat{T}$, respectively, and  
for simplicity we assume an affine mapping between the coordinates:  
\[
x = F_T(\hat{x}) = A_T \hat{x} + x_0   
\]
The Jacobian of the mapping is 
\[
\frac{\partial x}{\partial \hat{x}} = J(\hat{x}) = A_T      
\]
For isoparametric elements, a basis function $\phi$
is the simply defined in terms of its associated function $\hat{\phi}$
on the reference
element, ie. 
\[
\phi(x) = \hat{\phi}(\hat{x}) .  
\]
With this definition we may easily evaluate integrals involving the basis functions: 
\[
\int_T \phi(x) \, dx = \int_{\hat{T}} \hat{\phi}(\hat{x}) \, det J \, d\hat{x},  
\]
where $det J$ is the determinant of $J$.  Furthermore, derivatives of the basis functions are readily available by using the chain-rule:  
\[
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x_i } = \sum_j  \frac{\partial \hat{\phi}}{\partial \hat{x}_j } \frac{\partial \hat{x}_j}{\partial \hat{x}_i } 
\]
As such the finite element engines may perform all the computations on the reference cells, which makes the implementation easy and efficient. 

\section{The connectivity of the mesh and the corresponding finite element space}

The Lagrange element of order 5 was illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:Lagrange5}. We observe here that the basis function $0$ and $5$ are associated
with the edges $x=0$ and $x=1$, respectively. The other functions are all zero at the edges. Hence, the basis function $1, \ldots, 4$ do not connect 
to any other element, whereas the basis $0$ would directly connect to the a corresponding element on the left whereas basis $5$ connects to the 
an element on the right, if present. Hence the edge nodes defines the connectivity and hereby the continuity towards the neighbouring elements. 

The situation is more complicated in 2D and 3D. Consider the Lagrange element of 1, 2, and 3 order in Fig.~\ref{fig:lagrangeelement13}. Black, blue and red circles mark
the vertex, edge and interal nodes, which through the connectivity of the mesh defines the connectivity of the finite element filed. 
Consider the mesh in Fig.~\ref{fig:Lagrange8elements}. Clearly, the vertex node in the center, marked by a black circle is connected to all the 8 neighbouring elements. 
Hence, the corresponding basis function ties these eight elements together.
